🏀 NBA Dataset - Data Modeling and Graph Representation 🏀
📌 Overview
This project models NBA data using both traditional dimensional modeling (star schema) and graph-based modeling (vertices and edges). The dataset includes teams, players, games, and their relationships, optimized for analytical queries and graph-based exploration. 📊

🏗️ Data Model
The dataset consists of the following key components:
1. Players Table (players.sql)
Stores individual player details and their performance across seasons. 👤
    •	Primary Key: (player_name, current_season)
    •	Key Columns:
    o	player_name: Player's name
    o	height, college, country: Background information
    o	draft_year, draft_round, draft_number: Draft details
    o	seasons: Array of performance stats per season
    o	scoring_class: Categorization based on performance (star, good, average, bad)
    o	years_since_last_active: Tracks how long a player has been inactive
    o	is_active: Boolean indicating if the player is currently active
    o	current_season: The year associated with the latest data entry
   
2. Teams Table (teams.sql)
Stores team-level metadata. 🏆
    •	Primary Key: team_id
    •	Key Columns:
    o	abbreviation, nickname, city, arena, year_founded: Team details
   
3. Games Table (games.sql)
Stores game-specific details including participating teams and outcomes. 🏀
    •	Primary Key: game_id
    •	Key Columns:
    o	season, game_date, home_team_id, away_team_id, home_score, away_score
   
4. Game Details Table (game_details.sql)
Stores detailed statistics of players in each game. 📊
    •	Primary Key: (player_id, game_id)
    •	Key Columns:
    o	start_position, pts, team_id, team_abbreviation: Player performance per game
   
5. Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) - Players History (players_scd_table.sql)
Implements a Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) to track player performance over time. 🔄
    •	Primary Key: (player_name, start_season)
    •	Key Columns:
    o	scoring_class, is_active, start_season, end_season
   
6. Graph Model - Vertices (graph_ddls.sql)
Defines the vertex structure for graph-based data exploration. 🔗
    •	Vertex Types: player, team, game
    •	Table: vertices
    o	identifier: Unique ID (e.g., player name, team ID, game ID)
    o	type: Enum representing the vertex type
    o	properties: JSON storing additional metadata
   
7. Graph Model - Edges (graph_ddls.sql)
Defines relationships between players, teams, and games. 🔄
    •	Edge Types: plays_against, shares_team, plays_in, plays_on
    •	Table: edges
    o	subject_identifier, object_identifier: Defines relationships between entities
    o	edge_type: Type of relationship
    o	properties: JSON storing relationship metadata
   
8. Player-Game Edges (player_game_edges.sql)
Creates edges between players and games they participated in. 🎮
    •	Edge Type: plays_in
    •	Table: player_game_edges
    o	player_id → game_id
    o	Properties: start_position, pts, team_id
   
9. Player-Player Edges (player_player_edges.sql)
Creates edges between players who played in the same game. 🤝
    •	Edge Type: shares_team
    •	Table: player_player_edges
    o	player_id_1 → player_id_2
    o	Properties: game_id, team_id

   
10. Pipeline Query - Player SCD Update (pipeline_player_scd_query.sql)
Processes the player SCD table by incorporating new season data. ⏳
    •	Updates player records annually
    •	Assigns scoring_class based on the latest stats
    •	Manages years_since_last_active tracking
    
11. Analytical Queries (analytical_queries.sql)
Prepares analytical insights leveraging both relational and graph-based structures. 📊
    •	Sample Queries:
    o	Retrieve top-scoring players
    o	Find most active teams
    o	Explore player career trajectories
    o	Graph-based shortest paths between players

    
🛠️ Usage
1.	DDL Setup: Execute the schema definitions for relational tables and graph structures. 🏗️
2.	Data Ingestion: Load data into tables using the defined structures. 📥
3.	Graph Model Execution: Populate vertices and edges from the dataset. 🔗
4.	SCD Processing: Update players_scd_table incrementally. 🔄
5.	Analytics: Run analytical queries for insights. 📊
   
🎯 Key Takeaways
•	Combines traditional star schema and graph models for flexible analysis.
•	Uses players_scd_table for tracking historical changes.
•	Graph model allows for advanced queries like shortest path and centrality. 🚀
This structure provides a comprehensive way to analyze NBA data from multiple perspectives. 📈

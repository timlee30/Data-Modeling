-- ðŸŸ© Step 1: Remove exact duplicate events (same url, host, user, timestamp)
WITH deduped_events AS (

        user_id,
        event_time
    FROM events

-- ðŸŸ¦ Step 2: Keep only events with user_id and add event_date (for same-day filtering)
clean_events AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        DATE(event_time) AS event_date
    FROM deduped_events
    WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL

converted AS (

-- ðŸ“Š Step 4: Aggregate by visited URL to calculate conversion rate
SELECT
    visited_url,
    COUNT(*) AS total_visits,
    CAST(SUM(is_converted) AS REAL) / COUNT(*) AS conversion_rate
FROM converted
GROUP BY visited_url

--     -- Only keep URLs with conversions and enough volume
--     CAST(SUM(is_converted) AS REAL) / COUNT(*) > 0
--     AND COUNT(*) > 100;

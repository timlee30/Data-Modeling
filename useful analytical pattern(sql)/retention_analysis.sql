-- These users all signed up 4 days ago

-- Youâ€™re now checking in on them on their Day 4

-- ðŸ‘¥ There are 45 users from that cohort who have a row in the users_growth_accounting table on their Day 4

-- ðŸ”¥ Of those, only ~9% were active on that Day 4 â€” meaning:

-- Their daily_active_state was 'New', 'Retained', or 'Resurrected'

-- ðŸ§Š The rest (91%) were likely 'Stale' or 'Churned' â€” i.e., they didnâ€™t return or havenâ€™t come back yet
